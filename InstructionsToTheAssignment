for the assignment we want to know 4 things namely
The monthly earnings
The return on investment
The estimated current value
The capital gains


so the above functions will act as functions for which we will get a value

there will be 3 sub structures , 1 main structure

each substructure for appartments , townhouses ,semi detached houses 

the main structure will have the following information:
 char name[34]
char address[64]
struct appartments appartment[5]
struct townhouses townhouse[5]
struct semi detached houses[5]


Sub structures are as following 
struct appartment{
char address[64]
int  Nrooms
int Nbathrooms
int PurchasePrice
int MonthlyR
int MonthlyCfees
int MonthlyEarnings
int annualReturn
int CurrentV
int CapitalG
}
	
struct townhouse{
char address[64]
int Nrooms
int Nbathrooms
int Pprice
int MonthlyRent
int MonthlyUtilities
int MonthlyCFees
int MonthlyPropertyTax
int MonthlyEarnings
int annualReturn
int CurrentV
int CapitalG
}

struct semi_detached{
char address[64]
int Nrooms
int Nbathrooms
int Pprice
int MonthlyRent
int MonthlyUtilities
int MonthlyProperty
int MonthlyPropertyTax
int MonthlyEarnings
int annualReturn
int CurrentV
int CapitalG
}



for the functions the following calculations wil take place 

double MonthlyEarnings(int MonthlyRent,Int MonthlyUtilities , int MonthlyPropertyTax){
monthly earnings = monthly rent - monthly utilities - monthly property tax

}
