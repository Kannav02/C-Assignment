for the assignment we want to know 4 things namely
The monthly earnings
The return on investment
The estimated current value
The capital gains


so the above functions will act as functions for which we will get a value

there will be 3 sub structures , 1 main structure

each substructure for appartments , townhouses ,semi detached houses 

the main structure will have the following information:
 char name[34]
char address[64]
struct appartments appartment[5]
struct townhouses townhouse[5]
struct semi detached houses[5]


Sub structures are as following 
struct appartment{
char address[64]
int  Nrooms
int Nbathrooms
int PurchasePrice
double MonthlyRent
double MonthlyCfees
double MonthlyEarnings
double annualReturn
double CurrentV
double CapitalG
}
	
struct townhouse{
char address[64]
int Nrooms
int Nbathrooms
int Pprice
double MonthlyRent
double MonthlyUtilities
double MonthlyCFees
double MonthlyPropertyTax
double MonthlyEarnings
double annualReturn
double CurrentV
double CapitalG
}

struct semi_detached{
char address[64]
int Nrooms
int Nbathrooms
double Pprice
double MonthlyRent
double MonthlyUtilities
double MonthlyProperty
double MonthlyPropertyTax
double MonthlyEarnings
double annualReturn
double CurrentV
double CapitalG
}



for the functions the following calculations wil take place 

double MonthlyEarnings(double MonthlyRent,double MonthlyUtilities ,double MonthlyPropertyTax){
monthly earnings = monthly rent - monthly utilities - monthly property tax;

}
double ReturnOnInvestment(double MonthlyEarnings,double Pprice){
rinvestment=100*12*MonthlyEarnings/Pprice

}

double CurrentValue(double MonthlyEarnings){
cvalue=12*MonthlyEarnings/interest rate(this is a value which will be pre defined in the main code , as 0.05)
}
double CapitalGains(double CurrentValue, Double Pprice){
CapitalG=currentvalue-Pprice
}

This sums up all our functions


now a code has been added by professor on his website , we shall use that code to get the required data for our structures ,
also before inserting the values inside the structure make a function that initializes the array of our structure .


thats it for the whole code 
iâ€™ll be making a skeletal code and publishing on github , check that out too , and make the required changes and then post them on github again , thanks
